# Applying data analysis on medical data to help improve society's quality of life

# Abstract
Large hospitals can generate up to hundreds of terabytes of medical data each year and this amount only increases with time.
In many countries (almost all developed countries), hospitals are by law required to store this medical data for 5 to 10 years.
As (nascent) data scientists we recognize that this medical data may contain information that could help improve society's quality of life. Unfortunately the great majority of medical data is simply stored and never used as a result of privacy laws and regulations. However, this consensus is starting to shift and effort is being made to help the medical field reap the benefits of Data Science.
In short, our goal is to refine medical data and extract useful information from it.

# Research questions

**Globalized view of medical data:**

**Imaging data:** <br>
A large portion of medical data that is being stored is imageging data, especially 3D imaging data from MRI & CT scans takes up a lot of memory. Since image data is not in the scope of this course, this will not be the main focus of the project.
