# Title

# Abstract
Large hospitals can generate up to hundreds of terabytes of medical data each year and this amount only increases with time.
In many countries (almost all developed countries), hospitals are by law required to store this medical data for 5 to 10 years.
As (nascent) datascientists we recognize that this medical data may contain information that could help improve health care.
It is therefore very dissapointing that as of today the large majority of medical data is simply stored and left unused, primarily due to privacy laws and regulations.
However, the consesus regarding these laws is starting to shift and effort are being made to help the medical field reap the benefits of Data Science. One of these effort is a website called "The Cancer Imaging Archieve (TCIA)" https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/
which contains a wealth of medical imaging data in a large variety of different forms (CT, MRI, microscopic biopsy, radiographs, ...)

In short, our goal is to refine medical data and extract useful information from it.

# Research questions
There's a lot of different questions one could ask depending on the concidered data.
An example file is provided in this repositoy where the LIDC-IDRI dataset is briefly explored and some questions are investigated. This dataset contains 1013 thoracic CT scans, and 2669 lung nodules (tumors) annoted by 4 different radiologists. Additionally some spreadsheets are provided which contain more information regarding count, size and malignancy of the tumors. 

Some ideas:

* It is commonly known that malignant tumors have an anarchic shape while benign tumors tend to be more spherical. This could be verified/quantified using this dataset. The anotations can be turned into 3D shapes of which the sphericity can be determined.

WE SHOULD TRY TO FIND MORE MEDICAL DATA, PERHAPS NOT IMAGING DATA.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
Add here a sketch of your planning for the next project milestone.

# Questions for TAa
It would be nice to have another source of medical data, perhaps not imaging data, does anyone happen to have a suggestion?
