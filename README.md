# Applying data analysis on medical data to help improve society's quality of life

# Abstract
Large hospitals can generate up to hundreds of terabytes of medical data each year and this amount only increases with time.
In many countries (almost all developed countries), hospitals are by law required to store this medical data for 5 to 10 years.
As (nascent) data scientists we recognize that this medical data may contain information that could help improve society's quality of life. Unfortunately the great majority of medical data is simply stored and never used as a result of privacy laws and regulations. However, this consensus is starting to shift and effort is being made to help the medical field reap the benefits of Data Science.
In short, our goal is to refine medical data and extract useful information from it.

**Imaging data:**



# Dataset
"The Cancer Imaging Archieve (TCIA)" https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/ contains a wealth of medical imaging data in a large variety of different forms (CT, MRI, microscopic biopsy, radiographs, ...)

Some other candidates:

### Nicer 
* https://www.nicer.org/en/data/nicer-database/


The nicer dataset contains cancer data (type of cancer, diagnosis, death...) for Switzerland by cantons. It seems to be complete and well organized. It respects medial naming conventions.
We need to request the access. 

You can find the description of it here : https://www.nicer.org/assets/files/data/ncd_4.1_abbrev_version_201706.pdf

###Â Ghdx health data

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

## Data exploration 
* Request the datasets mentioned above. Find alternatives if we can't get them. 
* Start exploring and cleaning the different datasets, find additional sources of data if needed. 
* Compare and confront the different datasets

## Research questions 
* From this, refine the exploration ideas and the research question.

## General & team management  
* Package the work and define tasks and a more precise timeline. 
* We will refine or list of internal milestone with the data we get
* Refresh on Spark
